Angle is a free and lightweight Sketch plugin for applying perspective transforms for your mockups. You can get the **[starting template](https://designcode.io/angle)** to help you design beautiful mockups from scratch. Check out the [full tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dps7vBlWMTc&t=1s).

# Getting Started
The only thing that Angle needs to work is an Artboard containing your Screen. That's it!

## Usage
Select a shape layer and do **Apply Mockup** `Command + \`.

- **Apply Mockup** `Command + \`: this will apply an Artboard to your selected shape.
- **Flip Mockup** `Command + Shift + \`: once a mockup is applied, you can decide to **Flip** it.
- **Rotate Mockup** `Control + \`.
- **Reset Mockup** `Control + Command + \`: remove the metadata that was applied to your mockup.

## Auto-Detect
When applying a mockup, Angle automatically detects all the Artboards, except the current Artboard. No expensive operations while you're designing, as this only happens when you run one of Angle's commands.

## Single Artboard
If you have a single Artboard with your screen, Angle will skip the modal and apply right away. Boom!

## Working with Symbols
If you have a Symbol that contains your Mockup, make sure to have an **Image Fill**. That's how Angle knows that your Symbol contains a mockup.

## Multiple Shapes and Nested Symbols
If you have multiple shapes or a Nested Symbols, you can apply the mockups to multiple destinations.

## Pixel Density
By default, it's set to **Auto**, which will detect the size of selected shape and apply a **2x** pixel density. You can set to **1x**, **2x**, **3x** or **4x**.

## Image Quality
By default, it's set the **Best**. While you'll get the highest quality possible, this will increase your filesize dramatically. By setting to **Better**, **Good** or **Average**, you will make the file smaller.
